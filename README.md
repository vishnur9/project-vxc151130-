# song-recommender-system
Created a song recommendation system as part of the Big Data course curriculum. 
Ultimately it gives to the user a set of top 10 recommended songs from about a million songs data available. 
Used Spark's library methods to design and train the model. 
Also used Pig to give a set of recommendations based on specific attributes of the song like genre etc.,
